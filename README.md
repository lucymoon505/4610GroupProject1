## Problem Description:
Our task at hand was to model and build a relational database system for an emergency healthcare clinic chain. At the core of this model is the Patient entity of the healthcare clinic, representing each new individual checked into the hospital as a patient. There are multiple patients in many different countries and cities. The database includes many different relationships with the patient, including prescription information and billing details. Information about patient appointments and their corresponding diagnostic tests are also available, along with additional detail about these scans. Our goal is to accurately model these relationships to swiftly deliver precise patient information, crucial in high-stakes environments like emergency healthcare clinics. Furthermore, we aim to enable seamless querying of this data, empowering doctors, nurses, and healthcare professionals with vital insights into doctor-patient relationships and the hospital's operational dynamics.
